## An Unclear Gap: How Vague Response Options Produce Partisan Knowledge Gaps

Roush and Sood (2023) use a dataset of 162,083 responses to 187 items on 47 surveys to find that partisan gaps are smaller and less frequent than commonly understood. The average is a mere six and a half points and gaps' ''signs'' run counter to expectations roughly 30\% of the time. However, one exception is the size of gaps on retrospection items on the ANES, which are considerably bigger. These retrospection items use vague response options, e.g., 'About the same.' Using a novel experiment, we find that questions featuring vague response options allow individuals to interpret potential answers through their own biases, inflating gaps' magnitudes. Our findings suggest that knowledge gaps---when they do exist---stem more from motivated responding than genuine differences in factual knowledge.
